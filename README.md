## Problem Statement

Health information needs are also changing the information seeking behavior and can be observed around the globe. Challenges faced by many people are looking online for health information regarding diseases, diagnoses and different treatments. If a recommendation system can be made for doctors and medicine while using review mining will save a lot of time. In this type of system, the user face problem in understanding the heterogeneous medical vocabulary as the users are laymen. User is confused because a large amount of medical information on different mediums are available.The idea behind recommender system is to adapt to cope with the special requirements of the health domain related with users.
## Our Solution
- To save the time required and also money for initial process of diagnosis symptoms, this project proposes an **Automated Disease Prediction System** that relies on user input.
- The system takes input from user and provides a list of probable diseases.
## Project Overview
In this Project we tried to unleash useful insights using this datasets and performed feature selection to build Automated Disease Prediction model by combining the power of best performing machine learning algorithms
This is the file which consist of dataset and there are various differnt algorithms used for training of our model which are as follows:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNearestNeighbour
- Naive Bayes

These four algorithms is used to train our model and all gives an accuracy of over 90
